Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members was wonderin'
Could you do a lil' som—
Somethin' beautiful, somethin' that the kids is gon' love when they hear it
That's gon' make them start jumpin' up and down, and sharin' candy and stuff
Think you could probably do somethin', for the kids, for graduation to sing?",66

Oh, yeah
I got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people that's—

[Chorus]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)

[Verse 1]
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer, they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin', man, your ass is grown

[Chorus: Kanye West with Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still aliveThrow your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

[Verse 2]
This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's
And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say
My niggas—

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by (
Yeah
)
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive (
Alive
)
Throw your hands up in the sky and say (
Uh-huh, yeah
)
""We don't care what people say"" (
Yeah, yeah, ugh
)

[Verse 3]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream: ""Rocks, blows, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
You tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromey wheels here
You tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say
My niggas—

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

What in the fuck was that, Kanye?!
I told you to do some shit for the kids!
You can give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now!
You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis!
You will not walk 'cross that stage, you won’t slide across that stage!
Motherfucker can’t pull you 'cross that muthafuckin' stage, Kanye!
Who told you? See, I told you to do somethin' uplifting!
I’m tryna get you out here with these white people and this how you're gon' do me?
You know what, you's a nigga, and I don’t mean that in no nice way
Had lil' kids sing about the shit—y'know, the joke's on you
You throw your motherfucking hands in the air and wave goodbye to every-motherfucking-body!
'Cause, you getting the fuck out of this campus!
What the fuck you gon' do now?

[Verse: John Legend]
I'm no longer confused, but, don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules, but, don't tell anybody
I got something better than school, so don't tell anybody
My momma would kill me, so, don't tell anybody
She wants me to get a good-ass job, just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody",206

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

Oh, when it all

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & 
Kanye West

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it all falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some 1s that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & 
Kanye West
]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou'
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou'
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 
106 & Park
, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & 
Kanye West

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

Oh, when it all, it all falls down

We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all, it all falls down

We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then, I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check—wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah, I stole—never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Asking me about some khakis
But let some Black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh, now they love Kanye
""Let's put him all in the front of the store""
So I'm on break
Next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Taking my hits, writing my hits
Writing my rhymes, playing my mind
This fucking job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude
Lock yourself in a room
Doing five beats a day for three summers
That's 
A Different World
 like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!""
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow!

[Verse 2: GLC]
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time (Woo)
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind
Lost my mama, lost my mind (Aww)
Life, my love, that's not mine
""Why you ain't signed?"" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only wanna ball, never wanna fall (Ugh)
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine (Ugh)
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime (Ugh)
Gotta make these haters respect mine (Yeah)
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves
Waiting patiently, I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holler at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sounds so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G
Same goatee, stayin' low-key, nope
Holler at God: ""Man, why'd You have to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me
Smoke my weed and count my Gs
Got a lot of people counting on me (That's right)
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace (That's right)
Should've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow!

Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Tryna make this thing right
And havin' one of my coworkers say, ""Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well, easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
That all had got snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn they back on me and didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally, actually, had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe, empty fridge is staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off, blaow!

That's right, it's what I do!
C'mon, uh-huh
Nah, you know I never let you down!
Gyeah, gyeah, yuh

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Yo, first, I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First, I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya, boy

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

Get up, I get

[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this, that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a Heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down

Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Woo-hoo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
Dissin' Jay, dissin' Jay'll get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please, Father forgive us'

I got the Bubba Kush and her sister could get a hit of it, yeah (Yo, yo)

[Verse 4: Common]
Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote
Control, rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show called ""Soul Survivor""
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch, I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marks is too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come you the hot garbage of
The year? It's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-
Red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a mad rapper
Just a MC with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, MCs retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher, then

[Chorus: Kanye West & Common]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high (Yeah)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high (Mm-mm, uh-uh, uh)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high (Keep 'em high, keep 'em high, uh-uh)
And if you're losin' your high, then smoke again
Keep 'em high",985

Man, at least a dude with a car

Nobody wants a little, tight ass

One, and two, and three, and four, and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and
Do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe
Get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son, don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and
Ooh, she's so excited
""Tell me who's invited""
You, your friends and my dick

It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but

Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

Ooh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said, ""Get It Wet""
Ooh, girl, your breath is harsh!
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks, yeah, I bought them cars
Still, kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day, girl, we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit, girl, I'll still hit, girl
One and, you brought two friends
Okay, three more, now hop in the Benz
Four door, do you know the difference between a five, six, seven, eight?
All the Mocha Lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballers

[Chorus: Kanye West]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking 'bout freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

Big-face hundreds and whatever other synonyms

I'm tryna spend my stacks, and I'm so broke

Now, even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for a free-ninety-nine
Later on, I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because
She my caddy 'cause she grab my golf balls in the club
And I'm still acting calm than a muh'
She asked, ""Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?""
While we drive, she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby, I fully understand; let me help you with a plan
While he tricking off, don't get no rich nigga

me
 some head—that'll really piss him off (Ugh)

I blow past low-class niggas with no cash
In a four-dash-six, bitch, you can go ask
So when I go fast, po-po just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever come first, I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever come second, I'll be there with my weapon
Pulling up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSeses was ambidextrious
Could've sworn her breast-eses was sending me messages
""K, I need a free hand-mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""
So, say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman

This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet, like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yo, you heard the track I did, man? ""This Can't Be Life""
Somebody please say grace, so I can save face

I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it, why the guard had to look all through it?

Got roaches at they crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousin

The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that 
College Dropout
 to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking 'bout how my dick head is?

I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes, sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes, sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl, he had with him, ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it, I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
""Oh my god, is that a black card?""
I turned around and replied, ""Why, yes
But I prefer the term African American Express""
Brains, power, and muscle
Like Dame, Puffy, and Russell

You know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""

No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""

[Saxophone Solo]

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called 
The Dynasty
. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre 
Chronic 2001
 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on 
The Dynasty
 album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day, I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh, you a real soulful dude.""

[JAY-Z: ""Oh, you a real soulful dude, man""]

And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said
[JAY-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]
""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""
[JAY-Z: ""So what you think of this?""]
And I was like, ""Man, that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man, I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like, I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...
[Donda West: ""Come on, let's just go""]
...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...
[Donda West: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]
...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played, like, seven beats. And, you know, I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo, play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later, I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo, what's up, I'm Kanye.""
[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]
""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""
[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]

You know, I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, 
The Streets is Watching
, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""

[JAY-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, 
Blueprint
, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-
Blueprint
 beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo, but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them ""Jesus Walks"" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me, though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...
[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

[""Y'all niggas is stupid""]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]

Dame was like, ""Yo, you got a deal with Capitol? Okay, man, just make sure it's not wack.""

[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""

Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""
[Dame: ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""]
""I ain't gon' front, it's kinda hot.""
[Dame: ""it's actually kinda hot.""]
Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""
[Dame: ""you don't wanna catch a brick""]
""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man, I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""

[Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""

[Intro]
West—Mr. West—Mr. West
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, like Tim, it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things we seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars—I know it

[Chorus: Kanye West & 
Adam Levine
]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (
Ooh
)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
(
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran' keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The Devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggarish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

[Chorus: Kanye West & 
Adam Levine
]
Ugh, and I heard 'em say (
Ooh
)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today (
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today

But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
With every worthless word, we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
And nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

Oh, ooh, ooh

I gotta testify

'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top, top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top, top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dawg, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Outro: Kanye West]
We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her

She walkin' 'round lookin' like Michael with your money

You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me ""K-Rock"" so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back— back then— then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had them Lincolns and auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dawg
Fuck all that flirting, I'm tryna get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me, ""Don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie""

Drive slow, homie

You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'
Them elbows poking wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth, relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawlin'? You see them screens fallin'?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on the switch, sittin' crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy-coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tippin' on them fours, I'm jammin' on this Screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie

[Chorus: Kanye West & 
GLC

Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homie
If you're ridin' around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homie
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flickin', and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil' bit (Just a lil' bit)
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain

Yeah
I'm on my way home

[Verse: Common]
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains. Divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game, it's another name for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail. Relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, ""Behold the Pale -
Horse"". Got me trapped like R. Kel'. I bail and it—

[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again",216

How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearin'
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes, I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it, nowadays, they can't tell if

From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the maricons lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say? ""We just tryin' to party, holmes""
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda, raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause...
Dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' the president—look, there's hope, man!
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks, man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that

See, I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a lil' somethin'-somethin' on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it, and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now, we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mamas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny

I know it's past visitin' hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin', like, ""What kind of doctor can we fly in?""
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You tellin' me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here?
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
""Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?"" But still

You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now, she 'sleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey, chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus, my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Klaye and Aunt Jean
So many aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's this ""1 Thing""
When they said that she made it, you see they eyes gleam
I think we at an all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive

We have to pray, besides what the pastor say

Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me

There'd always be somebody that'll shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the ""He say, she say""
Your girl don't like me? How long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say, ""Yo, no hablo inglés""

Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam, still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' 'bout the ones that be glowin', I'm talkin' 'bout Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here, it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because

The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better

(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you, and uh
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you, I'm goin' back to school, and
I appreciate what you allowed for me, and I
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey, Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine, I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi'
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said, ""Mommy, I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford""
See, you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what Heaven do
Sent us an angel, and I thank you, Mama

[Chorus]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you, and uh
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you, I'm goin' back to school, and
I appreciate what you allowed for me, and I
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey, Mama)

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""
My mama told me, ""Go to school, get your doctorate
Something to fall back on, you could profit with""
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""?
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni
Turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on, Mommy, just dance wit' me
Let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say ""Hey,"" y'all say, ""Mama""
Now everybody answer me, come on

[Chorus]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you, I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey, Mama)

[Break]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second they get up, you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let your friends know (Hey, Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag', whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say

[Outro]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you, and uh
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
You know I love you so, and
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go, our love is true

He looked up at me, said, ""Daddy, that's the reason why you had me?""
Yep. We was practicing

You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Say she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone!

[Hook 1: Kanye West and Cam'ron]
Gone
We striving home
Gone
I ride on chrome

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus, he already got three chil'r'n
Arguin' over babysitters like, ""Bitch, it's your turn""
""Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official""
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, now he at the top where dude belong
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

Well, here's the deal, ma, we going to the dealer, woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you, poof!
Poof, be gone, damn, tough luck, dag (Dag)
Niggas still doing puff-puff-pass (Puff, pass)
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched-up Jag, shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine, stay, you got the grind, hey
Came back, read what the sign say (Too late, he's gone)
Yes, I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah, you church, boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain't even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, chyeah
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now

[Hook 3: Cam'ron]
We striving home
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his mama with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking ""Cons, how long has this gone on?""
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning, he was gone with my bread
And with that being said, I had gone on my instincts
And goin' to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs

Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
I've been waitin' on this my whole life (And I wonder)
These dreams be wakin' me up at night (And I wonder)
You say I think I'm never wrong (And I wonder)
You know what? Maybe you're right, aight?

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know

You say he get on your fuckin' nerves (
And I wonder
)
You hope that he get what he deserves—word! (
And I wonder
)
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just tryna find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet, and that's what intuition is (And I wonder)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib, run back to their arms
The smokescreens, the chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 3: Kanye West & 
Labi Siffre
]
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline, told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm (And I wonder)
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God callin' from the hotlines
Why he keep givin' me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine? (
And I wonder
)
How many ladies in the house? (
If you know
)
How many ladies in the house without a spouse? (
What it means
)
Somethin' in your blouse got me feelin' so aroused (
What it means
)
What you about? (
And I wonder
)
On that independent shit (
If you know
)
Trade it all for a husband and some kids (
What it means
)
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?
(
To find yo
ur dreams come true

I'll never be laid back as this beat was

Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up? You see how I played a big
Role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?

Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am

And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows?
So, say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough, Mr. West, please, no more today

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
My name is Windy and I like to blow trees,"" and
From that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me""

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes, I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud

Stadium status

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
It's the 
Hard Knock Life
 Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
That he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

[Chorus]
Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel, why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 2]
Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'Round the same time of that 
Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
But by 
The Black Album
, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 3]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
Translate, español: ""No way, José""
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

[Bridge]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

It's so crazy, crazy-crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason, I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about
Do you think I'd sacrifice real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
Do you think I'd sacrifice a real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell and my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight
To live a real life

I just wanna be a real boy
They always say: ""Kanye, he keeps it real, boy""
Pinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy

[Verse 2]
It's funny
Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin' for something out there, trying to find something
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life, to be real?
Not some façade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say: ""where's my camera?""
For everybody that sees you to say: ""sign an autograph""
For everybody that sees you cryin' that say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh

And there is no Gepetto to guide me
No one right beside me
The only one was behind me
I can't find her no more, I can't call her no more
I can't—
The only one that come out on the tour and screams
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get-got
And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen up on the TV screen
And when, uh, the Benz was left
And the clothes was left, and the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death thinkin' the money that the—
You spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left for a real boy

We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it

I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?

Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a 
South Park

I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls

Ayy, yo
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

Not for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me

Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty

With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Ma$e screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase, so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat, haha
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's ""Dior Homme,"" not ""Dior, homie""
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation, haha
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)

Or do anal, or do a gangbang

I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day?
'specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On the bathroom wall I wrote
""I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fuckin' self
'Til about 2 a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect, but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Grippin' you up, fuckin' and chokin' you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't gettin' this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be havin' mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You gettin' blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls""
""All of the lights,"" she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied bein' in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Chloe Mitchell

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called, it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing

Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often-entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary codenames that preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you

Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like, ""Damn, I was just with him after school""
No shop class, but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day""-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine Black power
Forty-one souls murdered in fifty hours

The paper read, ""Murder, Black-on-Black murder""
The paper read, ""Murder, Black-on-Black murder"" again

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Is it genocide?
'Cause I can still hear his mama cries
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago

Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries, and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new Black elite
They say my Black Card bear the mark of the beast
I repeat, my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few Blacks the higher I go, uh
What's up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh
That ain't enough, we gonna need a million more, uh
Kick in the door, uh, Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go, uh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Yeah, it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What's the life expectancy for Black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause there ain't nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes

So when love is gone 'til blood is drawn
'Cause we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you, squares, the circle got smaller
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller
And truth be told, after all that said
Niggas still got love for you

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
Showed love to you niggas
You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
I picked up the pieces 'fore you swept on it
Goddamn, this shit leaves a mess, don't it?
Shit feelin' like death, don't it?
Charge it to the game, whatever's left on it
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it
Fly, pelican, fly, turn the jets on it
But first I shall digress on it
Wasn't I a good king?
Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?
Didn't I spoil you? Me or the money, what you loyal to?
Huh, I gave you my loyalty
Made you royalty and royalties
Took care of these niggas' lawyer fees
And this is how niggas rewarded me, damn

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
But I'm bulletproof, bitch, you can't get nothin' past me
Got body armor
A nigga gotta watch the throne
And I'm bussin' back
So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones
What do you do when the love turn to hate?
Gotta separate from these fuckin' fakes
Caesar didn't see it, so he ceased to exist
So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
Am I my brother's keeper?
Only if that nigga don't creep up
Got a pistol under my pillow
I've never been a deep sleeper
P-P-P-Paranoia, 
'cause the nigga that said he'll
Blast for ya

Relivin' the past?
Your loss

[Verse 1: King Louie]
Rockstar, bitch, call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night, my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out first day of school
'Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' 'em, honey, how I make the pain improve

This the craziest shit in the club (Woo)

She say, ""Can you get my friends in the club?""
I say, ""Can you get my Benz in the club?""
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the soles I'm in
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin' close to him
Yeezus just rose again

[Chorus: King Louie]
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It just mean, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me (
Los Angeles
)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)
Big, big money (Money, money, money)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker

[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla—, pla—, pla—

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man, you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man, they would have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man, they would have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, ""Get your money""
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk, they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', now y'all get the message?!
On the field, I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (You!)
Ten-thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (You!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (You!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury
I give 'em Grey Poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!
If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for, huh?
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
(We did)
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (You!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (You!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama mama house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (Sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man, it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah, ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2

Yeah-yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My wife said I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate, we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That 
TIME
 cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky

Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, ""How my neck look?""
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (
Real!
)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego when confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow

[Bridge: Sampha]
Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring

Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you
Oh, the invisible truth stay sober
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky

[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(
Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm
)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(
Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm
)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

[Verse: Kanye West]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name

Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age

Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that

I don't take advice from people less successful than me

Had to tell the dogs, ""Turn the snubs off""

And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once

All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters

This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (

Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like"" (
Stretch my hands to You

I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (

Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle

That's when **** hit the fan and all of a sudden, all the facts show
You gotta chin up and show a **** tough love
Let 'em go without you just to show 'em what it was
We was so close, you would've thought we was blood
We got the same pain, we come from the mud
I swear this **** make me wanna put my all in it, yeah
You can hear the pain 'cause I put my heart in it, yeah
Most of these **** ain't real, they don't wanna see me winnin', no
Most of these **** ain't real, they don't wanna see me winnin', no

[Outro: Kanye West & Rooga]
But it's okay, we gon' be okay
Only show up when we cut the cake (Oh, yeah)
Showin' love, but we okay (We okay)
Find God 'fore it's too late",647
